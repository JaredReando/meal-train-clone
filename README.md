## Description

This project is a case study in Angular which aims to clone the popular meal giving site Meal Train. It is a work in progress and meant only for educational purposes.

My primary focus for the project was replicating the basic functionality of the Meal Train service. Namely, the ability for a user to create a new event and review details of existing events from an overview dashboard:

The original site has a few features I wasn't able to figure out just yet. Specifically, the multiple date selection interface proved challenging
