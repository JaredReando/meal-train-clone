## Description

This project is a case study in Angular which aims to clone the popular meal giving site Meal Train. It is a work in progress and meant only for educational purposes.

My primary focus for the project was replicating the basic functionality of the Meal Train website. Meal Train is a neat way to organize meal delivery to friends and family for all sorts of big life events. You create an event, add dates, and let invitees to the event know some particulars about your food preferences and availability. When it's your day to bring a meal, you personally delivery it, say hello, and sometimes stick around for a while to share the meal and chat. It's a lovely service.

The original site has a few features I wasn't able to figure out just yet. Specifically, the multiple date selection interface proved challenging. I'm still getting the hang of HTML/CSS styling as well, which so far has limited the look of my clone in relation to its source material. Future work will address styling improvements as well as increased functionality, as currently the user is only able to add an event and view bare details of previously entered events.
